# Feature Recognition
The Feature Recognition Project is a computer vision project that aims to recognize and classify specific facial features in real-time. The project contains three main features: Mask Recognition, Gender & Age Recognition, and Emotion Recognition. The project is built using several powerful libraries in Python, including TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, imutils, and scikit-learn, and allows the user to train their own models to recognize specific features using their own pictures. The project can be used with any version of Python 3.7, making it highly flexible for different system setups. The core of the project is a GUI that allows the user to run the entire project with just a click of a button.

The Mask Recognition feature is designed to recognize if a person is wearing a mask or not, and the user can train their own model using their own pictures. The Gender & Age Recognition feature uses a pre-trained model to predict the gender and age of a person in real-time. For Emotion Recognition, the user can also train their own model using their own pictures, and the project will analyze facial expressions to determine the person's current emotional state, such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, or neutral.
